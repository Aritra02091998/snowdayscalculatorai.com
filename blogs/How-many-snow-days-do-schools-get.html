    <h2 class="article-title">How Many Snow Days Do Schools Get?</h2>

    <article class="article-body">
      <p>
        Snow days are a winter tradition‚Äîbut how many do schools actually get each year?
        The answer depends on your location, weather patterns, and district policies.
        Thanks to tools like the <em>snow day calculator</em>, students and parents can now get clearer, faster predictions about closures before they happen.
      </p>

      <h3>Average Snow Days Per Year</h3>
      <p>
        On average, U.S. public schools experience anywhere from <strong>2 to 10 snow days</strong> per year.
        Northern states like New York, Michigan, and Minnesota tend to have more,
        while southern states often see one or none.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the <em>AI snow day calculator</em>, you can track and estimate how many snow days your district may get‚Äî
        based on historical data and live weather inputs.
      </p>

      <h3>Why Some Schools Get More Than Others</h3>
      <p>
        Several factors affect how many snow days a district uses:
        annual snowfall totals, city infrastructure, access to plows and salt, and regional weather volatility.
        That‚Äôs why the <em>snow day calculator Michigan</em> operates very differently from the
        <em>snow day calculator Canada</em> or Florida.
      </p>
      <p>
        College campuses, too, use separate models‚Äîlike the <em>snow day calculator college</em>,
        which accounts for campus walkability and snow-removal systems.
      </p>

      <h3>How Schools Set Snow Day Limits</h3>
      <p>
        Most school districts build in a set number of ‚Äúemergency closure days‚Äù into their academic calendars‚Äî
        typically between <strong>3 and 5 per year</strong>.
        If more snow days are needed, schools may have to make up days later in spring or shorten holidays.
      </p>
      <p>
        That‚Äôs why tools like the <em>snow day chance calculator</em> can help both students and administrators
        stay informed and prepared.
      </p>

      <h3>Can You Predict Snow Days in Advance?</h3>
      <p>
        Absolutely. The <em>snow day predictor calculator</em> uses real-time weather data from
        sources like <em>AccuWeather</em>, plus school history, elevation, and policy info
        to calculate your odds of a closure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're using the <em>snow.day calculator</em>, the <em>snow day calculator 2024</em>,
        or checking results via the <em>snow day calculator app</em>, you‚Äôll get reliable,
        hyperlocal estimates of upcoming school cancellations.
      </p>
