    <h2 class="article-title">How Much Snow Does It Take to Have a Snow Day at School?</h2>

    <article class="article-body">
      <p>
        One of the most common winter questions from students and parents alike:
        “How many inches of snow does it take to cancel school?”
        The truth is, there’s no single number that applies everywhere—but with the help
        of modern tools like the <em>Snow Day Calculator</em>, you can find out what
        matters most for your location.
      </p>

      <h3>Understanding the Threshold: It’s Not Just About Inches</h3>
      <p>
        While many people assume a snow day happens after 3–5 inches of snow, the real
        decision depends on several factors—like road clearing speed, timing of snowfall,
        ice conditions, wind chill, and even school policy history.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why the <em>snow day chance calculator</em> doesn’t just consider total
        accumulation. It evaluates dozens of variables in real time to predict
        cancellations with surprising accuracy.
      </p>

      <h3>Different Schools, Different Standards</h3>
      <p>
        In states like Michigan or Minnesota, a school might remain open through 6 inches
        or more. But in southern states, even 1–2 inches—or the mere threat of ice—can
        trigger closures. That’s why the <em>snow day calculator Michigan</em> gives
        vastly different results than in, say, Georgia or Texas.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some colleges are even more snow-resistant. For example, the <em>snow day calculator college</em> model
        factors in pedestrian infrastructure and campus maintenance capabilities, which
        can differ from public K–12 districts.
      </p>

      <h3>How the AI Snow Day Predictor Works</h3>
      <p>
        Our system uses a proprietary <em>snow day calculator formula</em> that combines
        real-time weather data (including sources like AccuWeather), local closure
        history, elevation, and neighborhood response rates. The result? A personalized
        snow day percentage that updates hourly.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s why more people trust our platform as the <em>best snow day calculator</em>
        — because it doesn’t guess, it learns. And it works across the U.S. and Canada.
      </p>

      <h3>How Much Snow Is “Enough” for a Day Off?</h3>
      <p>
        Here’s a general estimate based on national averages from our data:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>❄️ 1–2 inches: Rare closures unless paired with ice or extreme cold</li>
        <li>❄️ 3–4 inches: Possible closure in moderate-risk districts</li>
        <li>❄️ 5–6 inches: High probability of cancellation in most areas</li>
        <li>❄️ 6+ inches: Strong snow day probability in nearly all districts</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But again, these are just patterns. Your district’s response may vary—and that’s
        why you need a smarter tool to estimate your odds.
      </p>
