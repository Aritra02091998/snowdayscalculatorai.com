    <article class="article-body">
      <p>
        For students, teachers, and even parents, there are few words more exciting in winter than:
        <strong>‚Äúsnow day.‚Äù</strong> But what exactly qualifies as a snow day, and how is it decided?
        That‚Äôs where tools like the <em>snow day calculator</em> can help provide clarity‚Äîfast.
      </p>

      <h3>Defining a Snow Day</h3>
      <p>
        A snow day is an unexpected school or work closure caused by severe winter weather.
        This could mean heavy snow, ice storms, dangerously low temperatures, or hazardous road conditions.
        Snow days are typically declared by school administrators, often in the early morning hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        But predicting one isn‚Äôt always easy‚Äîand that‚Äôs why millions now rely on the
        <em>AI snow day calculator</em> for a data-driven forecast.
      </p>

      <h3>Who Decides Snow Days‚ÄîAnd Why?</h3>
      <p>
        District superintendents or school officials evaluate multiple factors before declaring a closure:
        local snowfall, ice levels, plow schedules, wind chills, and even past closure trends.
        That‚Äôs why the <em>snow day calculator formula</em> takes more than just inches into account.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, the <em>snow day calculator Michigan</em> uses very different criteria than
        what you'd see in Texas or North Carolina. In snowy regions, schools may stay open with 4‚Äì6 inches
        on the ground, while southern districts might close over an inch of slush or a freezing drizzle.
      </p>

      <h3>How the Snow Day Calculator Works</h3>
      <p>
        Our <em>snow day chance calculator</em> uses real-time weather inputs from trusted providers like
        <em>AccuWeather</em>, school closure history, elevation data, and AI-driven models to predict
        the chance of school being canceled.
      </p>
