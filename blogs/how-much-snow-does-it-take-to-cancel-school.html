    <h2 class="article-title">How Much Snow Does It Take to Cancel School?</h2>

    <article class="article-body">
      <p>
        Every winter, students across the U.S. and Canada wake up and ask the same question:
        ‚Äú<strong>How much snow does it take to cancel school?</strong>‚Äù
        The answer depends on where you live, how your district operates, and what weather conditions are coming your way.
        Luckily, tools like the <em>snow day calculator</em> can help break it down.
      </p>

      <h3>There‚Äôs No Universal Number</h3>
      <p>
        While 3‚Äì6 inches of snow might seem like a likely threshold, there's no nationwide rule.
        Some schools close at just 1 inch of snow‚Äîothers stay open with 7+ inches.
        Factors like road clearing, ice, temperature, wind chill, and timing all play a role.
      </p>
      <p>
        That‚Äôs why the <em>AI snow day calculator</em> uses a complex <em>snow day calculator formula</em>
        to predict whether your school might cancel tomorrow.
      </p>

      <h3>Why Location Matters</h3>
      <p>
        In snowy northern states like Minnesota or Michigan, districts are well-prepared and less likely to close.
        But in places like Georgia or Tennessee, even a light snow dusting‚Äîor a forecast of freezing rain‚Äî
        can shut schools down. The <em>snow day calculator Michigan</em> uses different thresholds than
        the <em>snow day calculator Canada</em> or southern states.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <em>snow day calculator college</em> version also takes pedestrian traffic and campus infrastructure
        into account‚Äîideal for students at universities and colleges across the U.S.
      </p>

      <h3>How the Snow Day Calculator Predicts Closures</h3>
      <p>
        Our <em>snow day chance calculator</em> analyzes weather data from providers like
        <em>AccuWeather</em>, road conditions, historic closures, and more.
        The result is a real-time snow day percentage tailored to your ZIP code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you‚Äôre using the <em>snow.day calculator</em>, <em>snow day calculator 2024</em>,
        or the newest <em>snow day calculator 2025</em>, the engine behind it remains the same‚Äî
        smart, fast, and incredibly accurate.
      </p>

      <h3>Estimated Snow Day Thresholds by Region</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>‚ùÑÔ∏è <strong>1‚Äì2 inches</strong>: Rare closures unless paired with ice or cold temps</li>
        <li>‚ùÑÔ∏è <strong>3‚Äì4 inches</strong>: Moderate chance in suburban and rural districts</li>
        <li>‚ùÑÔ∏è <strong>5‚Äì6 inches</strong>: High cancellation probability in most areas</li>
        <li>‚ùÑÔ∏è <strong>6+ inches</strong>: Very high snow day likelihood almost everywhere</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Remember, these are just patterns. The <em>calculator snow day</em> model helps personalize these numbers
        based on your region.
